### **About Me**  
I design and deploy **AI agents and language-driven solutions** that bridge cutting-edge research with real-world applications. My work focuses on creating intelligent systems that are intuitive, actionable, and human-centric—whether through fine-tuning LLMs, designing RAG architectures, or building autonomous workflows.  

Passionate about **generative AI, agentic automation, and ethical AI deployment**, I build technology that doesn't just process data but *understands* and *acts* on it meaningfully.
